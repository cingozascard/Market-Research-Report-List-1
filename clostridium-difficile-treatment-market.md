<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clostridium Difficile Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Narrow Spectrum Antibiotics</li><li>Broad Spectrum Antibiotics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Clostridium difficile treatment market is divided into narrow-spectrum and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics target specific bacteria, effectively treating C. difficile infections while minimizing disruption to the gut microbiota. This approach reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance. In contrast, broad-spectrum antibiotics target a wider range of bacteria; they are used when the specific pathogen is uncertain but can disrupt the microbiome significantly. Each type plays a crucial role in managing C. difficile infections, depending on clinical needs.</p></p>
