<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top Coating</li><li>No Top Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermal paper market is primarily categorized into two types based on coating: top coating and no top coating. Top-coated thermal paper features a protective layer that enhances durability, resist smudging, and improves image quality, making it suitable for high-quality printing applications like receipts and labels. In contrast, no top coating thermal paper lacks this protective layer, resulting in a more cost-effective option, but it may be less resistant to environmental factors and smudging, limiting its applications. Both types cater to diverse industry needs.</p></p>
