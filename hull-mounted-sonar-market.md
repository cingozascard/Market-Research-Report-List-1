<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hull Mounted Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar Type</li><li>Active Sonar Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hull-mounted sonar market is primarily divided into two types: passive and active sonar systems. Passive sonar systems listen for sounds emitted by underwater objects, such as submarines and marine life, allowing for stealthy monitoring without revealing the sensor's location. In contrast, active sonar systems emit sound pulses and analyze their echoes to detect and locate targets. Each type serves distinct naval and maritime applications, with passive systems focusing on surveillance and intelligence, while active systems emphasize detection and classification capabilities.</p></p>
